				Philanthropy
				</h2>
				<p>
				This year, our chapter at Virginia Tech is supporting the One Love Foundation in their efforts to increase education and awareness about relationship abuse. Approximately 
				1 in 3 women, and 1 in 4 men, will be in an abusive relationship in their lifetime, and college students are at 3 times greater risk than any other age group. We have 
				partnered with One Love and our national fraternity to spread awareness and help end relationship abuse. Our campaign is dedicated to spreading the word by facilitating 
				educational workshops through One Love and campus outreach. 
				</p>

				In addition to our own philanthropy, we participate in many philanthropic events around the Virginia Tech campus such as the Big
				Event, Pi Beta Phi&#39;s Dodge the Arrow, , Kappa Alpha Theta&#39;s Pasta for Casa, Alpha Chi Omega&#39;s Trivia Night as well as many 
				others. We recently placed 1st overall in Gamma Delta Sigma&#39;s event Bracket Power, as well as 2nd overall in Pi Beta Phi&#39;s event Dodge the Arrow!
